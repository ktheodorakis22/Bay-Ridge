Hello!

My favorite neighborhood is Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. [Here](https://github.com/ktheodorakis22/Bay-Ridge/blob/master/map%20(2).geojson) is an outline of Bay Ridge on a geojson map.

According to the on the [Census Tract Finder](https://geomap.ffiec.gov/FFIECGeocMap/GeocodeMap1.aspx) on the FFIEC site, Bay Ridge has 600 families, 1076 households, and 2,276 residents as of 2016. 16.43% of the population are minorities. Other demographics are included in this document of [Bay Ridge](https://github.com/ktheodorakis22/Bay-Ridge/blob/master/seminar%20my%20neighborhood.pdf). 

In Fiscal Year 2016, there were over _53,900_ tickets given to residents in the 68th Precinct, which oversees my neighborhood. Using filtered data from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2016/kiv2-tbus/data), I was able to determine the top ten license plates that received the most parking tickets in FY 2016 which can be seen in this [python code](https://github.com/ktheodorakis22/Bay-Ridge/blob/master/HW%202%20Part%203.py).
